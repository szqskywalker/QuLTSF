# QuLTSF: Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Quantum Machine Learning. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13769)



## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a new Conda environment with python 3.11.7
   
2. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Download data. You can download the weather dataset from [Autoformer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy). Create a seperate folder ```./dataset``` and put the weather.csv file in the directory.


### QuLTSF

1. Training: All the scripts are in the directory ```./scripts/```. For example, to train the QuLTSF model you can use
```
sh scripts/QuLTSF_seq_len_336.sh
```
It will start to train QuLTSF model with fixed sequence length 336 and varying prediction lengths.
